# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

Amazon has a Vine product review program, where people pay a fee to receive goods from companies and then leave reviews of what they thought of the products. 

The following PySpark picture shows a dataframe of the reviews of Electronic equipment, as well as what kind of reviews are left and how many people thought the reviews were helpful.
